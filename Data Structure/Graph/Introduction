A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph can be defined as,
A Graph consists of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and set of Edges which connect a pair of nodes.
Graphs are used to solve many real-life problems. Graphs are used to represent networks. The networks may include paths in a city or telephone network or circuit network. Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedIn, Facebook. For example, in Facebook, each person is represented with a vertex(or node). Each node is a structure and contains information like person id, name, gender, locale etc.



##More on Graph Data Structure
Mathematical graphs can be represented using an array of vertices and a two-dimensional array of edges. Before we proceed further, let's familiarize ourselves with some important terms −

Vertex − Each node of the graph is represented as a vertex. 
Edge − Edge represents a path between two vertices or a line between two vertices. 
Adjacency − Two node or vertices are adjacent if they are connected to each other through an edge. 
Path − Path represents a sequence of edges between the two vertices. 


##Basic Operations
Following are basic primary operations of a Graph −

Add Vertex − Adds a vertex to the graph.

Add Edge − Adds an edge between the two vertices of the graph.

Display Vertex − Displays a vertex of the graph.
